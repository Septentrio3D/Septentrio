# Septentrio
Polar kinematics enable compact machines with a simple mechanical design. For Septentrio, these advantages were used to design a high-performance and reliable 3D printer. It was always tried to apply the KISS principle.

Special features:
- Compact 
- very rigid mechanics
- simple electronics
- polar kinematics

# FAQ
##Do I need any special tools to build my own septuple?

Besides a 3D printer with a build space of at least 220x200x200, no special tools are needed.

What material should be used for the 3d printed parts?

A combination of PETG and ABS is recommended. PETG should be used especially for the base to facilitate printing. ABS should be used especially for the thermally stressed parts near the hotend or motors. Some polyamides may be a better but more expensive solution. (LUVOCOM 3F PAHT® 9825 NT and LUVOCOM 3F PAHT CF 9891 BK based filaments are recommended).

What are the advantages of a Polar printer?

Polar kinematics allow easy construction of a very compact printer. At the same time it is possible to achieve high printing speeds.

What are the challenges of a Polar printer?

In order to print geometrically accurate parts, the printer must be well calibrated with respect to its zero point. In addition, the printing speed near the center point is relatively low. 

Which extruders can be used?

Currently, only the Sherpa Mini is supported, since it can be 3d printed. But it should be very easy to adapt the design for other extruders.

Which hotends are supported?

Septentrio was developed with the Dragonfly hotend in mind. Other V6 compatible hotends should work as well. Support for the Mosquito hotend is planned.

What are the material costs?

The material costs are currently estimated at about 500€.
